QP,ID,key element,points
P1,1,cwnd is incremented by one every time a segment is acknowledged results in an exponential growth,"0,125"
P1,2,until either a packet is lost or ss_thresh is reached,"0,125"
P1,3,After a packet is lost / congestion both phases ss_thresh = cwnd / 2 reset to 1,"0,125"
P1,4,Congestion Avoidance,"0,125"
P1,5,cwnd is incremented more slowly,"0,125"
P1,6,grow linearly until a packet is lost,"0,125"
P1,7,ss_thresh = cwnd / 2,"0,125"
P1,8,Then cwnd reset to 1,"0,125"
