P1,1,"1. to use temporarily valid TSAPs -method: -TSAP valid for one connection only -generate always new TSAPs -evaluation -in general not always applicable:-process server addressing method not possible, because -server is reached viaã€€a designated/known TSAP - some TSAPs always exist as ""well-known""","0,5"
P1,2,"2. to identify connections individually -method: -each individual connection is assigned a new SeqNo and -endsystems remember already assigned SeqNo -evaluation -endsystems must be capable of storing this information -prerequisite: -connection oriented system (what if connection-less?) -endsystems, however, will be switched off and it is necessary that the information is reliably available whenever needed","0,5"
P1,3,"3. to identify PDUs individually: individual sequential numbers for each PDU -method: -SeqNo basically never gets reset -e.g. 48 bit at 1000 msg/sec: reiteration after 8000 years -evaluation -higher usage of bandwidth and memory -sensible choice of the sequential number range depends on -the packet rate -a packet's probable ""lifetime"" within the network","0,5"
