  <questionText>A company is planning to set up a new LAN at one of their locations and is looking for an appropriate medium access procedure. However, the funding is tight so they expect the channel load to be high compared to the hardware they can provide. Currently, they would like to have 20 systems sharing the channel, but it should be expandable later on. Which of the MAC procedures introduced in the lecture (Polling, TDMA with or without Reservation, Token Ring, Pure or Slotted ALOHA, 1-persistent CSMA, p-persistent CSMA, non-persistent CSMA or CSMA/CD) would you recommend?Give 2 reasons for your decision and 1 potential weakness of your recommendation in 2-6 sentences.</questionText>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.6">
      <response>I would recommend using non-persistent CSMA for the following reasons:
1) The channel is expected to have a high load and non-persistent CSMA ensures a low number of collisions compared to other protocols and works thus better on high loads.
2) More systems will be added to the LAN in the future so scalability is very important. Non-Persistent CSMA is perfect in this case, because it requires no changes no matter how many systems are added in the channel.

One Potential weakness of using non-persistent CSMA is that the throughtput will be low if only a few Systems are trying to use the channel. It can happen that multiple stations wait, even when the channel is idle.</response>

      <response>Non-persistent CSMA would be recommended in this case for 2 reasons. At first, CSMA avoid collision as much as possible by checking the channel before sending anything. Non-persistent CSMA provides the highest throughput in case the channel load is high. However, it has a potential weakness, the channel will be delayed longer than other MAC procedures. Other MAC procedures are not sufficient in terms of channel load and efficiency.</response>

      <response>The company should go with a standard CSMA/CD MAC procedure. The main reason for this is that it is possible to add stations easily to an existing network. Furthermore, it is a cost efficient MAC procedure which is a benefit due to the tight funding. A possible weakness is that the througput could be poor due to collisions due to high channel load.</response>

      <response>I'll choose CSMA/CD, because it costs efficient, it can detect the collision,but it has short frame.</response>

      <response>I would recommend the non-persistent CSMA.
First, it has high efficiency and high throughput. From a rate of about 5 attempts per packet time, it beats most of the other systems in terms of throughput.
Second, the normalized throughput increases with increasing attempts per packet time. This enables and even supports expandability.
A potential weakness is the throughput at low attempt rates. In these cases the non-persistent CSMA is inefficient.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.103">
      <response>Based on the channel utilization slide of the lecture I would recommend the use of p-persistent CSMA (with a low value for p), because it has a high channel utilization that:
(1) scales well for more systems sharing the channel
(2) reduces the amount of collisions with the use of fixed time slots and medium sensing before sending (wait until medium is not busy)

One disadvantage is that it can not terminate the sending when a collision occurs, instead, it waits until a random time interval, senses the channel and retransmit the frame if the medium is not busy.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.119">
      <response>I would recommend CSMA/CD.
The reason is that CSMA/CD checks the channel before and during sending frames.
Also if the sending station detects a collision it immediately interrupts the transmission, which saves time, bandwidth and avoids wasteful transmissions.
And because of the collision detection, its efficiency is better than the "simple" CSMAs.
Furthermore, the advantage in contrast to coordinated access like Token Ring is if more and more systems are added it takes more time until a station that wants to send gets the token.

A weakness of CSMA/CD would be if more systems are added the performance decreases.</response>

Token Ring: 
+ Good throughput even if the utilization is high and scalable for the future growth of the company.
- It can come to some delays because of the waiting time for the token.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.142">
      <response>I recommend the token ring, because (1) only one system can send at a time (the one with the token), so the channel load is reduced and (2) the token ring procedure is collision-free and works decentralized. 
Potential weakness: the token can be lost if the system which is currently holding the token unexpectedly disconnects from the network.</response>
      <response_feedback>Actually, the token ring needs a central monitor (See slide 73, LAN slide set).</response_feedback>

      <response>Token ring
Advantages: still expandable, high usage, due to token ring: sending only possible when sender has ring; prevention of collisions, no random waiting time

      <response>I would recommend to use token ring for the following reasons:
- As they expect the channel load to be high it is no advised to use CSMA/CD or a variant of it as that will cause a lot of collsions. Whereas token still performs reasonable well during increased utilization
- The other requirement is that it should support 20 systems and should be expandable later. Token ring can support a maximum of 250 stations and can be extended with coax or optic fiber later on (for increased transmission rate). 

One potential weakness is:
- As their funding is tight CSMA could still be considered as it is a lot more cost efficient than token ring.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.285">
      <response>For this use case I would recommend CSMA/CD as MAC. The reasons for this are 1. that due to the high channel load collisions are expected and terminating the sending after an detected collision minimizes the time the channel is clogged up compared to CSMA without collision detection or even ALOHA. 2. CSMA is easier scalable than contention free access MACs since there is no need to authorize a sender in any form before sending, every sender checks the channel on its own and can send data when the channel is free. A potential weakness could be, depending on the access mode used by CSMA. Since currently the channel load is high compared to the hardware capacities using the non-persistent access mode with its higher efficiency could further strain the hardware. Although this could change in future when the system is expanded.</response>

      <response>CSMA/CD is recommended because 1) it provides better throughput than other MAC procedures in overall, especially when the number of systems sharing the same channel is expected to increase further. This is important because the channel load is high due to the limited provided hardware. Secondly, 2)  CSMA / CD saves time and bandwidth due to interrupting the transmission when a collision is detected (which is highly probable ). A potential weakness of CSMA \ CD's ability of collision detection depends on the maximum distance between the stations within the network. If the LAN network expands further there's a risk that CSMA / CD won't be possible anymore.</response>

      <response>I would recommend non-persistent CSMA. It does not need a precise timer which is great for a tight budget and it has a high efficiency at the cost of longer delays for single stations. It can be expanded pretty easily by just adding new stations.
ALOHA is not a good choice here, because of its low channel usage and CSMA/CD needs a reliable collision checking while 1-persistent CSMA has a low throughput at higher load and p-persistent CSMA needs a precise timer.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.4.353">
      <response>CSMA/CD will be better.
Because it's random access procedures and can add new systems more easily than coorinated ones. Using a collision detection will save more time and bandwidth than ALOHA and other CSMA procedure.
The weakness is that the station in CSMA/CD procedure cannot send and receive frame at the same time, so  this procedure is only suitable for Half-duplex commnuication.</response>

      <response>CSMA/CD:
Reasons:
1. there are 20 systems sharing the channel, so it should be Random Access.
2. stations know whether the channel is in use or not before trying to use it, so it should be With carrier sense

Potential weakness:
1. CSMA/CD has no maximum waiting time.</response>
