  <questionText>What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous transmission mode in the Data Link Layer.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="2.2_DLL.a1">Asynchronous transmission: Every character a self-contained unit surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit, which is an easy and cheap pattern, but causes low transmission rates.

Synchronous transmission: Several characters pooled to a continuous stream of data (frames), Frames defined by SYN or flag, higher complexity, but higher transmission rates. Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.</referenceAnswer>

      <response>Synchronous transmission sends data in a sort of blocks or frames.

In Unsynchronous transmission the data is sended in form of byte and character.
Start and  Stop-Bits are added.</response>

      <response>asynchronous: characters are bounded with a start and stop bit, the transmission rate is low with up to 200bit/sec

synchronous: characters are pooled in frames with a SYN or flag - this has a higher transmission rate and is also more complex</response>

      <response>In an asynchronous transmission each byte is sent separately and has a start and an end bit.
In a synchronous transmission data is sent in frames which can lead to higher transmission rates but becomes more complex.</response>

      <response>Asynchronous transmission sends single bytes which are bounded by a start bit and an end bit.

In comparison synchronous transmission is able to send a block of bytes (Frame). These blocks are defined by SYN or flag.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.2_DLL.138">
      <response>In the asynchronous transmission mode, there is a start bit and a stop bit for every single character (byte) [ START | BYTE | STOP ].The synchronous transmission mode packs several bytes into a frame and a synchronisation flag is used to mark the begin and end of a new frame [ SYN | BYTE 1 | ... | BYTE n | SYN ].</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.2_DLL.141">
      <response>Asynchronous mode transmits characters separately and marks their boundary by using a start and stop bit, while synchronous mode groups multiple characters into frames where bounds are specified using control flags or a length field or invalid symbols of the physical layer.
Asynchronous mode is simpler, but it's also slower than synchronous mode due to the increased overhead.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.2_DLL.208">
      <response>During asynchronous transmission each Byte of the transmission is bounded by a start and a stop bit. This makes it possible to transfer data at all time.
With synchronus transmission the sender has to wait for the reciever until he is ready, so a transmission has to start with SYN flags. After the SYN Flags all Bytes of the data can be transferred without being bounded with start and stop bits. This leads to a higher transmittion rate than with the asynchronus transmission.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="2.2_DLL.227">
      <response>The difference is that in synchronous transmission mode the information which is to be transmitted is packed in frames, whereas in asynchronous transmission mode a single character represents a frame, which is bounded by a so-called start bit and a stop bit. So the asynchronous transmission have low transmission rates but is simple and inexpensive, in contrast the synchronous transmission is more complex but has higher transmission rates.</response>

      <response>asynchronous: byte- and block-oriented
synchronous: character-, count- and bit-oriented</response>
      <response_feedback>The differences mentioned in the response are incorrect. The correct difference is: In asynchronous transmission, every character unit is surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit. In synchronous transmission, several characters are pooled into a frame.</response_feedback>

      <response>On the asynchronous transmission, we transmit character independently from each other. Each byte is delimited by a start bit and a stop bit. 

One the Synchronous transmission, whereas, several characters are regrouped in a "frame". 

The Synchronous transmission is generally more complex but faster.</response>
