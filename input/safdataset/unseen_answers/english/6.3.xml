  <questionText>In the lecture you have learned about congestion control with TCP. Name the 2 phases of congestion control and explain how the Congestion Window (cwnd) and the Slow Start Threshold (ss_thresh) change in each phase (after initialization, where cwnd = 1 and ss_thresh = advertised window size) in 1-4 sentences total.</questionText>

    <referenceAnswer id="6.3.a1">Slow start: ss_thresh is constant, increment cwnd by one every time a segment is acknowledged until ss_tresh is reached, then slowed increase of cwnd Congestion Avoidance: cwnd is reset to 1 after adjusting ss_tresh = cwnd / 2</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="6.3.8">
      <response>1. Phase: Slow start
2. Phase: Congestion Avoidance
In the first phase Congestion Window is doubled until there is a time out or the Slow Start Threshold is reached. 
If there isn't any time out, the Congestion Window is incremeted by one.
After a timeout the Congestion Window will be set to one and the ss_thresh willl be set to the half cwnd.
This process continues at the begining Congestion Window size of 1.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="6.3.46">
      <response>The congestion control consists of two phases: slow start and congestion avoidance. After the initialization of cwnd and ss_thresh, the slow start tries to discover the proper sending rate as quickly as possible by incrementing the cwnd by 1 for each acknowledged package. This is continued until the ss_thresh is reached or a packet gets lost, then the congestion avoidance starts. Now each time a congestion occurs, the ss_thresh is set to cwnd/2, the cwnd is reset to 1 and the slow-start is entered again.</response>
      <response_feedback>In the congestion avoidance phase, the cwnd is increased linearly before congestion occurs is not mentioned.  Congestion avoidance starts ONLY WHEN the threshold is reached , not when packet loss occurs.</response_feedback>

    <studentAnswer id="6.3.59">
      <response>The two phases are "Slow start" and "Congestion Avoidance". To make sure the network is not overloaded immediately, a TCP sender will start to send "slowly": First one segment, then as long as the segments get acknowleged double the rate each time, until the ss_thresh value is reached. This means after the first ACK is received, the sender will send two segments at once, then four, eight, etc until the ss_thresh value is reached or no ACK is received. If the ss_thresh value is reached (phase 2) the sender will increase the rate linearly by one each time. If a packet times out the ss_thresh value is set to 50% of the current rate and the cycle is repeated with phase 1.</response>

      <response>The first phase, slow start, will double cwnd every round-trip time by increasing it by 1 for each received ACK. When cwnd reaches ss_thresh, the congestion avoidance phase is entered. The congestion avoidance phase will additively increase cwnd by 1 every round-trip time.If congestion is encountered in any of the phases, ss_thresh is set to half the value of cwnd, cwnd is set to 1 and the slow start phase is entered.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="6.3.111">
      <response>The goal of the slow start phase is to quickly find a good sending rate. 
For each ACK that is received, the cwnd is incremented, effectively doubling the cwnd within the round trip time.
The congestion avoidance phase starts as soon as either a packet loss occured or cwnd is greater or equals to ss_thresh and the cwnd is only incremented once each round trip time. 
When a timeout occures, ss_thresh is set to half of cwnd, cwnd is reset back to one and the slow start phase is entered again.</response>
      <response_feedback>Congestion avoidance phase starts only when  cwnd &gt;= ss_thresh. Packet loss can occur in both phases, resulting in ss_thresh = cwnd / 2 and cwnd = 1</response_feedback>

Phase 2: Congestion Avoidance

      <response>The two phases are called "Slow start" and "Congestion avoidance". When cwnd is smaller than ss_thresh the slow start phase is in action and cwnd is rapidly increased in a short amount of time by incrementing it by one each time a segment is acknowledged resulting in doubling the rate exponetially by doubling it every RTT. If cwnd is greater (or equal) than ss_thresh the congestion avoidance phase starts where as long as non-duplicate ACKs are received the cwnd may be increased by 1 MSS every RTT (AIMD). When a timeout occurs ss_thresh is set to cwnd/2 and cwnd is set to 1 and another slow start phase is entered resulting in alternating slow start and congestion avoidance phases.</response>
