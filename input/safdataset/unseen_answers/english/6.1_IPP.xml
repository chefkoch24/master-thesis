    <studentAnswer id="6.1_IPP.52">
      <response>Here are 5 objectives of the IPv6: 

-To support billions of End systems (2^128), much more than IPv4 (2^32).
-To simplify the protocol. For example, the header of the IPv6 is much simpler than the header of IPv4. 
-To coexist with the older protocol. For example, thanks to tunneling, IPv6 can coexist with IPv4. 
-To add more security in the network. 
-To be open for eventual future evolutions (for example with the extension headers).</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is correct because all stated objectives of IPv 6 are correct.</response_feedback>

    <studentAnswer id="6.1_IPP.290">
      <response>IPv6 is able to support billions of end-systems because it is using much longer adresses than IPv4.
Since IPv4 is still very popular and the internet protocols version can't be switched instantly IPv6 have to coexist with other protocols.
The extension headers used by IPv6 enable changes in the future.
To simplify protocol processing IPv6 uses simplified headers.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is correct as all the IPv6 objectives are completely accurate.</response_feedback>

    <studentAnswer id="6.1_IPP.337">
      <response>1. Enlarge the available address pool:
    By increasing the IP address length from 32 bits to 128 bits, a greater number of addresses can be assigned to end systems.
2. Simplify protocol processing:
    Any previous shortcomings in IPv4 can be removed and optimized in IPv6.
3. Provide Multicasting:
    Packets can now be sent to multiple destination addresses, which makes multicasting possible.
4. Better Security:
    Security means are already integrated in IPv6.</response>
