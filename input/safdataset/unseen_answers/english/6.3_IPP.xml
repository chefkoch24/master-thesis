      <response>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol designed as a replacement for the RARP and BOOTP protocols, with some additional functionality.
As such, it is is a protocol used for managing client IP addresses in a LAN.  
When a client first joins a network, it sends out a so-called 'DHCP Discover packet', which is a way for the client to tell the DHCP server (usually the local router) that it needs a valid IP address.  
The DHCP server then responds, assigning an IP address and optionally some additional addresses (like the default netmask or router) to this host. The assigned address will be valid only for a certain duration specified by the host in the response.  
The client now has to renew its IP address (by sending out yet another DHCP Discover packet) before the assigned address expires.

As long as the address hasn't expired, it is safe for the client to assume that his current address is still valid, even after being disconnected from the network for some time.</response>

      <response>The DHCP protocol is used to simplify the configuration of ip adresses of end systems. It is used to dynamically assign ip adresses to the participants of a network, while still enabling administrators to configure ip adresses manually. Every end system is able to configure itself with the help of the dhcp-server. The end system sends a dhcp discovery broadcast, the dhcp identifies itself and afterwards they negotiate the ip adress, as well as other parameters like time server, name server, domain name and subnet mask.</response>

      <response>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a network management protocol used on Internet Protocol networks whereby a DHCP server dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks. A DHCP server enables computers to request IP addresses and networking parameters automatically from the Internet service provider (ISP), reducing the need for a network administrator or a user to manually assign IP addresses to all network devices.

DHCP is used for:
Simplifies installation and configuration of end systems
Allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment
May provide additional configuration information (DNS server, netmask, default router, etc.)</response>

      <response>The dhcp protocol is a protocol to configure systems that join a network.
It is used to assign ip addresses to systems within the network. 
If a system joins the network it can ask the dhcp server for network configuration and an ip address that it should use in the future.</response>

      <response>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is Internet Protocol based on the special server that uses for manually or automatically IP addresses assignment and other network configuration parameters, such as subnet masks and default gateways, to each device on a network so they can communicate with other IP networks.
This server need not be on the same LAN as the requesting host. Since the DHCP server may not be reachable by broadcasting, a DHCP relay agent is needed on each LAN.</response>

      <response>DHCP is used to manually/automatically assign IP addresses to physical devices inside of a network with the help of a DHCP server. A client with no IP address sends a broadcast DHCP discover packet to everyone on the network. The Server will respond with a DHCP offer, where he offers an IP address to the client. The Client will then respond with a DHCP request (telling the server he wants the IP address). The Server will assign the IP address to the Client for a certain time period (DHCP ACK). After this leasing time, the client has to renew the leasing of the IP address otherwise the DHCP Server will remove the IP address of the client again.</response>
