      <response>Class A contains all IP addresses with first octet from 0 to 127 (IP address format is octet1.octet2.octet3.octet4)

According to slide 45 of Internet Protocols:
Addresses in range 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 are reserved, because they are used for loopback testing.
Addresses in range 0.0.0.0 to 0.255.255.255 are reserved, because they refer to hosts of the current network.

(So, excluding these 2 groups, each network with starting octet X, 0&lt;X&lt;127 of Class A has address X.0.0.0 for the network, X.255.255.255 for broadcasting and the rest addresses between these 2 for hosts).</response>

      <response>Just to note: originally I understood the task to mean reserved addresses within the network (i.e. concerning the host part), but then there was an official statement in the forum that the network part was meant. If it is indeed the host part, then *.0.0.0 and *.255.255.255 would be reserved within each Class A network.
Reserved addresses in Class A networks:
0.0.0.0 - 0.255.255.255 (host at this network)10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (Class A private network range)127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 (local host)</response>
