  <questionText>Let us assume that you flip a coin 6 times where the probability of heads (H) showing up is 0.6. Please arrange the following events in the increasing order of their likelihood (i.e., least probable → most probable): ● Event A: you see at least three H’s ● Event B: you see the sequence HHHTTT ● Event C: you see exactly three H’s Include justification in your answer headers.</questionText>

    <referenceAnswer id="12.1_PE.a1">The correct sequence is BCA , where B is the least probable. One of the following justifications should be given:
		● Event B is a subset/part/special case of C, and C is a subset/part/special case of A
		● Event B is more specific/strict than C and C is more specific/strict than A
		● An actual, correct calculation of the probabilities:
		○ P(B) = 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 *0.4 = 0.6^3 *0.4^3 = 0.013824 
		○ P(C) = (6 choose 3) * P(B) = 0.27648 
		○ P(A) = P(C) + P(Y=4) + P(Y=5) + P(Y=6) = 1 - P(Y=0) - P(Y=1) - P(Y=2)
		= (6 choose 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 + (6 choose 4) * 0.6^4 * 0.4^2 +(6 choose 5) *
		0.6^5 * 0.4 + (6 choose 6) * 0.6^6
		= 0.27648 + 15 * 0.020736 + 6 * 0.031104 + 1 * 0.046656
		= 0.8208 
		○ The answer may be rounded to up to 2 decimal places, e.g. P(B) = 0.01 or
		P(B) = 0.014
		○ It is also sufficient to give a formula without the actual calculation, if it is apparent that P(B) less than P(C) less than P(A), e.g. by stating P(C) = 20 * P(B)</referenceAnswer>

      <response>B -&gt; C -&gt; A

B is the least propable, because there is only this one combination out of 64 possible combinations. The propability is 1,38% ( 0,6*0,6*0,6*0,3*0,3*0,3). C is more propable, because out of the 64 combinations, 20 combinations can satisfy this condition (formula would be 6!/3!*3!) and results in 27,63% propability. The most propable case is A, because it contains B and has the propabilities of having 4 Hs, 5Hs and 6Hs added onto it, which results in 82,08% propability.</response>

C -&gt; in between
A -&gt; most likely

All three Events have the same minimum amount of H's in their sequence which indicates that the probability order is based on the number of permutation. 
B has least likelihood because it has the least amount of possible permutations (exactly one).
A has the most amount of permutation because it also allows permutations with more than 3 H's. So the permutations of C are a proper subset of the permutations of Event A. 
In this case the probability of H is larger than 0.5 so that is even more likely that there are permutations with more than three H's. But it would also hold true if this was not the case.</response>

      <response>Order: B-C-A
The probability of having HHHTTT is the lowest because its the most specific outcome. Only one possible path. 
The probability of seeing exactly three H’s is the second lowest. It includes the probability of HHHTTT and all other possible orders to achieve exactly three H’s. 
Having at least three H’s is the most probable outcome of those three. It includes the probability of B and C plus all outcomes with more than three H’s.</response>

      <response>By calculating using the binomial distribution probability formula, it can be concluded that the probability of event C occurring is 0.2765. 
The probability of event A occurring is: P[event A]=P[you see exactly three H’s]+P[you see four H’s]+P[you see five H’s]+P[you see six H’s] =P(k=3)+P(k=4)+P(k=5)+P(k=6)= 0.2765+0.311+0.1866+0.0467=0.8208 (P is the binomial distribution)
The probability of event B occurring is 0.6*0.6*0.6*0.4*0.4*0.4=0.013824. 
Therefore the order is event B to event C to event A.</response>

      <response>From less probable to most probable: B, C, A.
Event B is very unlikely, because it is requiring a strict sequence of heads and tails, which can be calculated by 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 = 1.4%.  Event C is more likely than C, because it just requires 3 heads, which is less strict than B and includes B, it can be calculated by BinCoef(6, 3) * 0.6^3 * 0.4^3 = 27.7%. A is more likely than C, because it is less strict and having at least three heads as well includes C, having exactly three heads. It can be calculated as the sum for all k=3 to 6: BinCoeff(6, k) 0.6^k * 0.4^{6-k} = 81.1%.</response>

      <response>Order: Event B, Event C, Event A

Reason: Actually , Event B is a subset of C, and C is a subset of A, so the order must be  B -&gt; C -&gt; A.
              P(Event B) =  0.6 * 0.6 * 0.6 * 0.4 * 0.4 * 0.4 = 216/15625 = 0.013824
              due to the equation of the binomial distribution
              P(Event C) = 864/3125 = 0.27648
              P(Event A) = 5213/625 = 0.8208</response>

      <response>Event A ist the most probable event, because there are many sequences that accomplish it. So all the probabilities of these sequences can be added to calculate the probability of Event A.
Event C iss less proabable than A, because there are less sequences to accomplish ist than there are to accomplish A. For example A sequence with 4 H's would fulfill A but not C. But all of the sequences that fulfill C also would fulfill A. So C has the same probabilities that are beeing added to calculate the probability of A, but A has additional probabilities.
Event B ist the least probable, because the only sequence that fulfills it, is HHHTTT. And since this sequence also fulfills A and C, the probability of the occurrence of this sequence is just one of the probabilities that are been added to calculate the probability of A and C.</response>

      <response>Event B
Event C
Event A

Event B: This is because the probability of seeing exactly in sequence HHHTTT is very low as there can be many different combinations such as HTHHTH, HTHTHT and others similar to that but for having the sequence HHHTTT there is only a single combination so the probability is very low.

Event C: Then the probability of seeing exactly three H's as the probability for showing up a head is 0.6 so there is more chances that a head shows up so the probability of head is more so exactly three H's probability is also low.

Event A: The probability of seeing head at least three is more because the probability of head is more 0.6 so the probability of a tail is 0.4 so we consider for this circumstance 0 T, 1T, 2T and 3T so summation of all these gives us the probability of at least three H's</response>
      <response_feedback>The response correctly states the sequence of the three given events. The justification for the events C and A is incorrect as the exact probability of H is not relevant (except when P(H) = 1 or 0) as C is a subset of A.</response_feedback>
