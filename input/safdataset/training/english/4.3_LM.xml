      <response>A node A close to the frame generator can pick up a “free” token and transmit data with a higher probability than a node B far away from the frame generator if the network is highly loaded. Therefore, Node A has a preference when trying to send a packet compared with node B which is a fairness problem. Research to improve the DQDB protocol includes bandwidth balancing schemes to increase the fairness of bandwidth allocation.</response>

      <response>Networks that use DQDB in metropolitan areas suffer a fairness problem due to network control information. Propagation delays become much longer than the transmission time of a data segment. To tackle this problem, a rate control procedure is used that only requires a minor modification to DQDB network structure.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response answer is partially correct because it identifies the fairness problem due to network control information and propagation delays. But the lack of fairness is based on station locations.</response_feedback>

      <response>In the DQDB Network Architecture, there are two buses connected with nodes interacting by nodes with the 2 buses.
On each bus side there is a frame generator, preparing the transmission with frames, generating frames. 
If the request to send (and reservation) is too near on the frame generator of bus A or bus B,
than it is less likely that all nodes gets data, if other nodes demand it, so there is fairness problem depending on the distance
from the frame generators.</response>

      <response>The mentioned problem with Distributed Queue Dual Bus is fairness. Each node when it wants to send something, it has to make “reservation” on one side of a bus and then when allocated at the other side of other bus, it is able to send something. For this reason, some nodes which is located near either one or two ends of the two buses might have too much advantage and disadvantage when it comes to transmission reservation (near and far ends). Only nodes which are in between may have average fairness to reach both ends of the two bus.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="4.3_LM.420">
      <response>The more a node is located upstream (close to the head), the higher is its probability to get a free slot for sending or reserving:
Nodes can only use unoccupied slots for transmission (generated at the head of bus), so the closer they are to the respective bus end, the more disadvantageous it is for nodes willing to transmit, since the nodes located upstream probably already have slots occupied.
To compensate for this disadvantage (and advantage of the nodes at the beginning of the bus), a reservation for the own node can be sent on the other bus (than the one used for transmission), which also gives stations willing to make a reservation at the beginning of that very bus an advantage over those located downstream.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="4.3_LM.547">
      <response>The problem of DQDB is fairness due to implemented so called bandwidth balanding mechanism. It means, the network bandwith is fairly distributed among the stations and every stations is able to send the same amount data at the same time. This balancing mechanism results in portions of available badwidth which is unused.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is partially correct as it states the fairness problem in DQDB but in the wrong context. The stations have a fairness issue for reserving transmission rights that depends on the distance between a station and the frame Generator or the Slave Frame Generator.

      <response>In Distributed Queue Dual Buses, stations (nodes) are connected to two unidirectional buses. When a station wants to send, needs to do a reservation in one bus. Just when that reservation reaches the other bus, the station can send the data. The problem in this architecture is how can we guarantee fairness between stations? In this architecture nodes are organized in a parallel way, so not all nodes are at the same distance. If the closer nodes send a reservation, that reservation will reach the send bus earlier than reservations from more distant nodes. If closer nodes do a lot of reservations, more distant nodes might not have the opportunity to send anything.</response>

      <response>The main issue with the Distributed Queue Dual Busses-system is the fairness of getting access to the network. Depending on its position relative to the BUS and the frame generators, one node may have higher chances to reserve bandwidth for transmission than other nodes - while middle nodes have a 50/50 chance, the nodes at the side have higher or smaller chances, depending on the bus direction. This was a big disadvantage for this system when it first came public, especially because there were other, more capable and fairer systems established at the same time, for example FDDI or ATM.</response>

      <response>To build a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN), which can combine asynchronous data traffic(IEEE 802.x MAC) and isochrounous traffic (ATM-B-ISDN), the DQDB (IEEE 802.6) was designed.
Therefore, two unidirectional buses are used. One bus is in the opposite direction of the other. A node is connected to both buses, on one bus data can be requested, on the other one data is sent.
The main problem with this architecture is, that a node can request more data than others depending on its position in the network.  So fairness is the issue with DQDB.

      <response>The problem is the fairness, because it can depend on the location of the station if you have an advantage or disadvantage in getting access to the bus and send data. This is, because to send data a station has to make a reservation on one bus and after the reservation arrives on the other bus, the station can send its data on that other bus (so reservation on one and sending on the other). Therefore the location of a station has influence on the fairness because for example if the station is at the beginning it could be more likely to get a reservation to send some data than it is when the station is at the end of the bus.</response>

      <response>The problem consists of the arrangement of the sending notes / stations. The stations reserve on one bus, that they want to send something and can then send if their reserved timeslot occurs. When the station at the end of the bus want to reserve something, then it might be possible, that there are no more free places to reserve, therefore it has to wait for the next cycle what is unfair in contrast to the other stations.</response>

The dedicated station that generates frames is intelligent and throws data away, which has been used already. It either generates free frames or puts the reservations on the other side. So depending on the location, it does make a difference in terms of fairness.
