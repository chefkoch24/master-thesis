<question id="5.7">
  <questionText>Consider the following topology from the exercise. This time, node A wants to distribute a packet using Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB). Assume that every IS knows the best path to A and also whether they are the next hop of their neighbors on the unicast path to A.Please list all the packets which are sent together with the information whether they will be forwarded or dropped at the receiving nodes. Use the following notation: (sender, receiver, drop) for dropped and (sender, receiver, forward) for forwarded packets. Please group these tuples according to the number of hops the packets have travelled so far. For dropped packets, please specify the reason why the packet has been dropped in a few words.Example for the notation:Hop 1:(C, A, forward)(C, B, drop) &lt;= describe reason hereHop 2:(A, D, drop) &lt;= describe reason here</questionText>

      <response>For the given scenario there will be no dropped packets, because every IS only forwards to their neighbor if they are on the unicast path from that neighbor to A. In this case this results in a de-facto spanning tree with no loops:
