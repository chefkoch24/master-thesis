      <response>The “collision domain diameter” is the distance two station can have and still detect a collision while sending. It depends on the minimum frame size, the speed of the signal through the medium and the bit rate of the network. If the bit rate increases while nothing else changes in CSMA/CD a frame is transmitted in less time than before. In this time the signal travels a shorter distance thus decreasing the “collision domain diameter”. If the speed of the network increases by a factor of 10 the “collision domain diameter” shrinks by a factor of 1/10</response>

      <response>since the smallest package is at least 64 bytes, the maximum collision domain diameter is calculated by the time it takes for the smallest package to travel at a certain speed. Thus, at 10 Mb/s = 1x10^7 bytes/s, 64/1x10^7 = 6.4x10^-6 s while on 100Mb/s, 64/100x10^7 = 6.4 x 10^-8 s. Thus the collision domain diameter is increased 100 times.</response>
      <response_feedback>The answer is incorrect as it states that the collision domain diameter increases 100 times, but for collisions to be detected, the diameter decreases by a factor of 10. For example, from 1000m to 100m.</response_feedback>

    <studentAnswer id="4.1_LM_v1.0.257">
      <response>In a CSMA/CD system the sender has to be able to recognize and react to collisions during sending. The minimal frame length is a measurement that stipulates how short a frame is allowed to be that it can travel back and forth through the longest distance between two stations in a network before sending is over. This allows the sender to detect collisions and prepare resending. The variables framelength, networkspeed and maximum distance (collision domain diameter) are dependant on each other.

Therefore, if one increases the speed of a network by a factor of 10, the framelength stays the same and then medium (cable) stays the same, then the collision domain diameter has to decrease by a factor of 10.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="4.1_LM_v1.0.418">
      <response>Collision Domain Diameter means the maximum length of line between two nodes in the network which you can use in respect to the length of used frames, the sending speed and the fact, that you want to be able to detect any kind of data collision during transmission. If we now increase the speed of transmission with all other factors remaining the same - especially the frame length -, the time of transmission for each node decreases. So there is less time of data frames travelling on the line during which the stations could detect a collision. To keep the function of collision detection, the maximum length of line - a.k.a. the Collision Domain Diameter - in the network has to decrease to the same factor. So an increase of transmission speed from 10 Mbit/s to 100 Mbit/s - factor 10 - causes a reduction of Collision Domain Diameter to the factor of 10, too. For example, in Ethernet 802.3 this means a reduction from 3000m to 300m.</response>

      <response>Using CSMA/CD, if we increase the speed of a network by a factor of 10, the collision domain diameter will decrease by a factor of 10 (about). This is due to the fact that the sender can recognize collisions only during simultaneous sending. And when we increase the transmission speed, we decrease the transmission time for a given distance. 

This will lead to higher among of collision or we should decrease the LAN size.</response>

      <response>If the speed is supposed to be increased by the factor 10 the consequence is that the collision domain diameter is going to be decreased by the same factor (in this case 10). 
So in this case by increasing from 10Mb/s (let's say it's here 4000m) the collision domain diameter is going to shrink on 400m if we want to increase on 100Mb/s</response>

      <response>The collision domain diameter will be shrinked by the factor of 10. ( for example 300m instead of 3000m). Because increasing the speed leads to the increasing of collisions,  so the collision domain diameter has to be small to detect the collision as soon as possible.</response>

What more, t_t = D(bits) / f(bit/sec), where D is data amount and f is the transmission frequency. t_p = a * l, where a is the transmission coefficient and l is the wire length.
