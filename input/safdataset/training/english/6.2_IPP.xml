  <questionText>What are extension headers in IPv6 and where are they located in a packet? What is the main advantage of extension headers compared to IPv4?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="6.2_IPP.a1">Extension headers are used to extend the fixed IPv6 header with additional, optional network layer information. If present, they are located between the fixed header/main header and payload/upper-layer header/ transport-layer header.

Main advantage: One of the following advantages are considered fully correct:
1. It allows the appending of new options without changing the header.
2. IPv6 packets with optional headers are typically processed faster/simpler by intermediate devices as most of the options are ignored (except “Hop-by-Hop Extension”) while they are processed by all routers in IPv4 unless ordered otherwise.</referenceAnswer>

      <response>Each IPv6 data packet consists of a header and the payload in which the user data is located. Compared to IPv4, the Internet Protocol v6 is characterized by a significantly simplified packet format. In order to facilitate the processing of IPv6 packets, a standard length of 40 bytes was specified for the header. Optional information that is only required for special cases is outsourced to so-called extension headers, which are embedded between the header data area and the payload. Therefore the main advantage is that options can be inserted without having to change the header. The IPv6 packet header now comprises only eight header fields with IPv4 thirteen fields were used.</response>

      <response>The functionality of options in IPv4 headers is removed and replaced from the main header through a set of so-called extension headers. They are additional headers in the IPv6 which are used for implementing more extensions. The main header has a fixed size of 40 bytes; the extensions headers, on the other hand, are optional and are added as needed. That means you can add extensions without planning it. There are several extension headers: Routing, Fragment, Destination, etc. 

The extension headers are placed between the fixed header and the payload. Every extension header points to the next header. There is also the possibility to refer to a "No Next Header" which is only to show that nothing else follows. It creates a chain, at the end of which is usually the TCP or UDP header.


Extension headers are a way to extend the header and put additional information between the payload and the header. They are optional, and that's why we have an absolute efficiency gain comparing to IPv4. Because in IPv4, we had at least one part for the option reserved, but in IPv6, we can say there are no extension headers, and so we have a smaller header and, therefore, much more space for the payload. Also, extension headers result in a significant improvement in router performance for packets containing options. In contrast to IPv4, the extension headers are only examined by a router when a packet arrives at its final destination and not along their delivery path.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is partially correct because the option field in IPv4 is not mandatory, and it is often 0 bit long in practice. Therefore, the efficiency gain advantage is incorrect. Also, the hop-by-hop extension header needs to be examined by intermediate routers too.</response_feedback>

      <response>Some of the missing IPv4 fields are occasionally still needed, so IPv6 introduces the concept of
extension headers. These headers can be supplied to provide extra information.

Extension headers are placed between fixed header and payload.

Main advantages: Extension headers are optional, so there is no space occupied if no extension headers are added. Also, they help to overcome size limitation and allow to append new options without changing the fixed header.</response>

      <response>Extension headers are a concept in IPv6 which allow to append new options to the IP packet. They are located between the fixed header and the payload and do not require to make any changes to the fixed header.

They are useful because they allow to add optional information to the packet in contrast to IPv4.

On the other hand the extension headers also overcome the problem of size limitation in IPv4 packets.</response>

      <response>IPv6 extension headers contain supplementary information used by network devices (such as routers, switches, and endpoint hosts) to decide how to direct or process an IPv6 packet. The length of each extension header is an integer multiple of 8 octets. This allows subsequent extension headers to use 8-octet structures.

IPv6 extension headers are located between fixed header and payload.

      <response>Extension headers are optional headers that can be placed between the main header and the data.  Each header has a reference to the start of the next header.  The main advantage is that it is more efficient from a space perspective, because it is no longer necessary to allot space in the fixed header for optional header information.  Instead, if there are no additional headers, the next header reference can just be empty.  Additionally, extension headers makes it easy to extend the header without having to modify the fixed size header.</response>

      <response_feedback>The description of extension headers is incorrect as most are actually defined in the IPv6 standard. Additionally, extension headers are located between the main and next-layer header instead of in the data portion.

      <response>Extension headers are an improved option mechanism for optional header information. They are placed after the fixed IPv6 header and before the payload. The Next Header field of the IPv6 header points to the first extension header and the Next Header field of this extension header points to the second and so on. The last extension header’s Next Header field points to the upper layer header within the payload of the IPv6 packet. 

Main advantages to IPv4: A major improvement in router performance for packets that contain options, because the Extension headers don’t need to be processed by any intermediate station (in IPv4 all optional informations need to be processed by any router). Another advantage of the extension headers in IPv6 is the flexibility towards future changes which can be appended without changing the fixed header.</response>

      <response>IPv6 extension headers contain additional information used by network devices. Those following are extension headers: Hop-by-hop options, Routing, Fragmentation, Authentication, Encrypted security payload and Destination options. Extension headers are located between the fixed header and payload in a packet.

The advantage of the extension headers in IPv6 compared to IPv4 is the optionality. If we don’t have any use for the extension header we have more space for the Payload. Which helps us to overcome the size limitations and we don’t have to change the fixed header, when we add extension headers.</response>
      <response_feedback>The "more space for payload" point is incorrect because the option field in IPv4 is optional, just like extension headers in IPv6. There is no space reserved in IPv4 for unused options. Apart from that, the answer is correct.</response_feedback>
