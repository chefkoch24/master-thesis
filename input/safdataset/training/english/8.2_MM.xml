  <questionText>WHAT is the purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast? HOW do they work?</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="8.2_MM.a1">Purpose: Both implement a more efficient kind (in terms of duplicate packets) of broadcasting than flooding / to minimize the number of duplicate packets in the network when broadcasting.

Reverse Path Forwarding:  Each node has a routing table stemming from unicast routing algorithms. When receiving a packet of sender S from neighbor N at node X, check the routing table and only forward the packet to all adjacent nodes (except for N) when you would send packets to S over N → the assumption is that the packet used the BEST route until now.
Reverse Path Broadcast: Nodes monitor unicast traffic to learn which paths in the network they are a part of, that is node X knows that is on the best path between two nodes A and B if it receives unicast packets coming from A and going to B or visa versa. In other words, each node knows which spanning trees it is part of in the network. Reverse Path Broadcasting works identical to Reverse Path Forwarding with the exception that it only forwards packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree (again excluding the incoming line to N).</referenceAnswer>

      <response>Purpose: duplicate avoidance and find the “best” route / shortest path with spanning trees, easy to implement Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF): Each sender knows the network as spanning tree for itself. Intermediate systems (IS) must not know the spanning trees. Once a packet arrived at a IS there are two possible ways to forward: (assuming shortest path transmission/”best route”) * Once a packet arrived from node A on the same link as node B expect packets by its routing table, then this packet will be forwarded to all other links except the incoming link. * Once a packet arrived from node A on another link as node B expect packets from A, then this packet will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): Works like RPF but chooses specific links for the outgoing traffic. By forwarding unicast packets an IS e.g. M learns whether it is located on the shortest path between two other nodes (e.g. node S and D). If this is not the case and S is sending a broadcasting packet, M would not forward this packet towards D as it knows that it is not on the shortest path from S to D. If M has learned that it is on the shortest path, it will obviously forward a broadcast packet to the destination. Depending on whether a certain path is used for unicast packets, an IS will use it to forward broadcast packets or omits the packets. Thus, the overall network throughput is reduced.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="8.2_MM.17">
      <response>These both methods are able to realize the broadcast routing upon a network.   Reverse path forwarding (RPF):  A sender broadcasts to all stations on the network. When a packet arrived at an IS, the IS will check if this path is the one which is usually used to communicate with the sender or not. If yes, the IS is able to resend the packet to all stations except the incoming one. If not, the IS will discard the packet. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB): It is almost like a improved version of RPF. If the packet reaches the IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent and the Packet has used the best route until now, select the edge at which the packet arrives, and then reroute it from that edge to the source S (reverse) , If no Packet has not used the best route until now, do not send over all edges (without incoming edges), i.e., not as in the Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF). If the packet does not reach the IS entry port, then the packet is discarded (the most likely duplicate).</response>
      <response_feedback>The stated purpose is missing the goal of minimizing the number of duplicate packets during broadcasting. Additionally, the description of RPB is slightly incorrect regarding discarding the packet if it "does not reach the IS entry port". Instead, the packet is discarded if it has not arrived at the IS entry, over which packets for this station/source are usually sent.</response_feedback>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding is used for loop free broadcasts of multicast packages, while reverse path broadcasting is an improved version of RPF. They work by assigning every Sender its own spanning tree, while the IS does not have to know them. If a Node gets a package from a link that it knows from its spanning tree is the best possible route to it, it resends it on every other port, if it gets a package on a port, that it knows is not the best route it discards it. RPB on the other hand improves this algorithm in a way that it looks at the package, if it always took the best route, not only if it arrived at the best port. This way far less packets get resend, which reduces the traffic on the network.</response>
      <response_feedback>The purpose is not limited to multicast but also used in broadcast. In RPF, a node decides whether the packet used the best route so far based on its routing table consisting of unicast information, not from the spanning tree. In RPB, IS only forward packets on edges that are part of a spanning tree, which is not clear from the explanation.</response_feedback>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast aim to reduce the number of packet copies in the network. In Reverse Path Forwarding, a node forwards a packet if the packet used the entry over which the packets for the source would be sent. This means, if the packet used the best-known route, the node then forwards to all edges, except the incoming one.   In Reverse Path Broadcast, a node forwards a packet if the packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets would be sent to the source station (used the best-known route). If the packet arrived on the best-known route, the node forwards the packet to selected edges: the edges used to reroute on the reverse direction to the source. Example of RPB: If a node A is not in the best-known route from B to C, then A will not forward a packet to B when the packet source is C.</response>

      <response>Both are broadcast routing methods that enables spanning trees without the IS required to know the spanning trees: RPF: A node receives a packet. If it arrived at the usual entry link, it assumes the packet used the best route until now and forwards it over all other links. If the packet arrived at a unusual link, it assumes it is a duplicate (because it didn't use the optimal path (of the spanning tree)) an discards it. RPF: works like RPF but doesn't forward the packet over all it's outgoing links but only to those which would send a packet to this IS to send a packet to the source of the original RPB-packet.</response>
      <response_feedback>The stated purpose is incorrect. It should be to reduce the number of duplicates and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths.

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding : It is for broadcasting, It is for fowarding and transmission packets in multicast routing without getting false IP addresses. It is a variation of the spanning tree, where every sender node has its own spanning tree and path. The intermediate systems in between don't need to know those. If the packets arrive at an IS, the packet used the best route available at that time. This is done by a resend over all edges, but not for the incoming one. If no packet arrived at the IS, the packet didn't use that route being not the best route. This is done by dismissing packets. Reverse Path Broadcast : It is for broadcasting. It is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. It works like reverse path forwarding but with a specific selection of the outgoing links. The "RPF" has the disadvantage of resending over all edges. It would be better to forward packets over suitable edges. So if a packet arrived at the IS over which the packets for this station are usually sent before and the packet has used the best route until now, the suitable edges are selected at which the packets arrived. From those packets they are rerouted and resent to the source C. Otherwise the packets are not send over all edges. If no packet arrived, discard the packets.</response>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding is a variation of the spanning tree.

Each Sender has its won Spanning Tree. So if a node revives something from one of its links it checks the source adress( example :A) and compares with its own table, if it would send something to A: Wold I use the same link for that ?

If that is the case the node knows that this is the optimal link for this direction.

→Assumtion Package used the best rout until now→Resend to all edges beside the incoming one.
If that is not the case →Assumtion this is not the optimal route →Discard the package because it is likely a unnecessary duplicate. 
Reverse Path Broadcasting is similar. But instead of sending it everywhere, after coming from the optimal rout, you send it only to the link that you would use to get to this destination.
Assumtion for both systems is that everything is working correct and everyone knows the directions the need to send</response>
      <response_feedback>The response does not state the purpose for both. The assumption behind them is that the packet used the BEST route
until now for sending unicast packets to the broadcast source. The remaining explanation for RPF and RPB is correct.</response_feedback>

      <response>The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast is to send (loop-free) multicast packets in multicast routing. Reverse Path Forwarding is more reliable (it can compensate if one router of the network has an error). Reverse Path Broadcast is more efficient, it relieves links, which are not the best path and therefore not necessary. Reverse Path Forwarding: If the router gets a packet, it looks where the packet comes from. If it is from a link, which its (unicast) routing table would also suggest to send via this link, this link is the best path and the router distributes the packet. Otherwise the packet is discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast: If the router B gets a packet, it also looks in the routing table, if the packet comes from the best path. If it is the best path (from router A), the router looks in the routing table whether a packet is ever send from C to A. If this is not the case, the link to C is not the best path and B doesn’t send it to C. So not necessary links are relieved.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response is partially correct because both RPF and RPB explanations didn't clearly explain how the packets are forwarded in a network. Additionally, the IS would also look whether packets are sent from A to C in Reverse Path Broadcast. The algorithms avoid loops not only in multicast but also in broadcast.</response_feedback>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast prevent loops in networks. Every router knows all routes to the other nodes but blocks all of them besides the shortest. If a packet now arrives at an intermediate system, it will be checked if the packet has used the shortest path so far by comparing the incoming direction with the usual direction packets with the same sender come from. In case it is the same direction it will be forwarded over every other edge besides the one where it has arrived. If it has arrived from another direction the packet will be discarded since it is most likely a duplicate. Reverse Path Broadcast uses Reverse Path Forwarding in an algorithm to send a packet to everyone with less duplicates than flooding.</response>

      <response>The purpose is to allow broadcast without storing a much additional for every IS like a spanning tree or remember past packages while also reducing the amount of package copies. RPF When an IS receives a broadcast massage from sender S it only forwards it, if it comes from a station the IS would use to send unicast messages to S. This assumes that the IS has learned over time which next station is the best one to take, when sending to S and that this hold when a package goes the other way. If the broadcast message is received from an other station the IS assumes this is a douplicate. RPB Refines RPF by not broadcasting to all available stations once a message has been received over the right station. In RPB the IS learns which neighboring stations are on a good path to S and the message is send only to those.

      <response>The purpose of RPF and RPB is to reduce redundancy, when broadcasting packets, on connection lines, which are not useful to the broadcasting process and try to create a spanning tree (without loops). In Reverse Path Forwarding the sender broadcasts its packets to its neighbours with their source node noted. They will rebroadcast the packets to their neighbours, only not back to the sender, until the packets reached every node. Every receiving node has to "ask itself the question": Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? If the answer is YES, it will assume that the received packets used the BEST route until now and they are rebroadcasted on all edges. Otherwise the node will assume that the packets did not take the best route until now and they will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a more complex version of RPF. In this scheme the packets will also carry information about the taken route. Every time a node receives packets it will have to "ask itself" two questions. First "has this packet arrived at the IS entry over which the packets for this source station are usually also sent? If the answer is NO, the packets will be discarded. Otherwise it will "ask itself" the next question. "Have the packets used the BEST route until now?" If the answer is YES the node will send the packets onto an edge. This edge lies on the best route from the destination node to the source node. Otherwise the packets will be discarded.</response>

      <response>The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) is the prevention of loops in a network when a multicast is sent from a node. It works in the way that each node has the knowledge about which node it would use for sending a unicast packet due to unicast routing algorithms. When a multicast packet arrives at a node’s entry port, the node would forward the packet to all other nodes (except for the one where the packet arrived) only if the node would also use this very node for sending the incoming packets to its source. Otherwise, the packet is discarded because it is most likely a duplicate. The purpose of Reverse Path Broadcast is to send a broadcast over the network without the occurrence of loops. It works in a similar way like RPF but here, a receiving node doesn’t forward the packet to all other nodes. A receiving node instead only forwards the packet to the node it would also send a unicast packet to.</response>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding and Broadcast are methods for broadcast routing. They enable improved flooding: it is checked whether a copy of a data unit has been received. If this is the case, no forwarding takes place to AVOID LOOPS. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (also called Reverse Path Flooding) (RPF) is a variation of the method spanning tree. Each sender has its spanning tree. The other nodes don't have to know the spanning tree. The assumption is that each router knows which path it would use for packets.  The RPF algorithm checks whether a packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually also sent. If yes, then the algorithm assumes the packet went the best path until now and resends the packet to all edges but the incoming one. If not, it assumes that the packet is a duplicate and didn't use the best route. This duplicate is then not forwarded but discarded. The significant advantage of this algorithm is its simple implementation. If a node assumes that a packet will reach it first by the shortest route, all that needs to be done is to ensure that a receiver can detect duplicates. As soon as a duplicate is received, it is assumed that the shortest route did not receive the packet, and it is not forwarded. The disadvantage of this method is that some nodes receive the packet unnecessarily several times. The REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is like RPF but with a specific selection of outgoing links. After the first check, the algorithm checks if the packet used the best route until then. If yes, it selects the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S. If not, it won't send over all edges. Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path concerning the interface on which the multicast packets are received but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to decide about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths.</response>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding and Revers Path Broadcast are used to forward multicast packages without using loops (and therefore not creating duplicates on the way). In Reverse Path Forwarding every node has its own spanning tree. When a package is received by an intermediate station, the station checks if it would send packages to the sender over the used link. If that is the case, then it should be the best route and the intermediate station forwars the package to all connected nodes (except the incoming edge). If it is not the case, then it gets discarded, because it is very likely a duplicate, from another node. Reverse Path Broadcast is an improvement on reverse path forwarding. Instead of forwarding packages to every node (if conditions for forwarding are met) it only forwars it to the node, from where packages would normally arrive from.</response>
      <response_feedback>The purpose of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is not limited to the multicast but also used in broadcast.

      <response>- REVERSE PATH FORWARDING: The main idea is here is that each sender has its own Spanning tree, but the IS do not need to know the spanning trees itself. _Algorithm:_ 1. node B sends unicast packets to destination node S using the shortest route via the node A 2. Node S sends braodcast packets to all nodes which are also forwared by A to B 3. Since B also can get the braodcasted packets from other nodes, the unicast routing information is used to determine which information to keep: - if the broadcastet packet from S did not arrive via A, ignore it because we know that the path via A is the shortest route - if the broadcastet packets arrived via A then keep the data because we know its the shortest route - REVERSE PATH BROADCAST:  The main idea here is to just use the edges, in the broadcast step, at which the packets arrived and reroute it to the source instead of broadcasting to all and every nodes. This helps avoiding duplicates. _Algorithm:_ 1. Node B sends unicast packets to Node S via node A. Where A inspects the packets and can learn the best path and also the best path in the reversed direction. Furthermore, other connected nodes to B can learn that they never did receive a unicast path from B to S, means they are not part of the path.  2. Now when S broadcasts the packets, just A fowards the packets to B. The other connected Node to B will not forward the packets to B because it knows it is not part of the best route → the connection from that node to B is relieved. The node does foward the broadcast packets from S to other nodes though.</response>

      <response>Reverse path forwarding (RPF) and reverse path broadcast (RPB) are techniques used in routers. They enable loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing. REVERSE PATH FORWARDING:  In this procedure, each node i checks whether an incoming packet from source q has been received on the connection on which node i also transmits its packets to q. If this is the case, then the packet is assumed to have been transmitted on the shortest route and it is forwarded on all other lines. If, on the other hand, a packet was received on a line other than the one on which data is transmitted to the sender, then it is assumed that it is a duplicate that did not take the shortest route. This duplicate is then discarded instead of being forwarded. REVERSE PATH BROADCAST:  RPB is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path with respect to the interface where the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of data to the interface of the router. As a result, multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces where the next router is located in the reverse direction on the shortest path to the data source. RPB specifically checks whether the incoming packet arrives at the IS through which the packets for this station/source are normally also sent.  If not, the packet is discarded directly. If yes, it will be further checked if the packet has taken the best path so far. If yes → select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction) If not → do not send over all edges (without the incoming one)</response>

In Reverse Path Forwarding, each sender maintains its own spanning tree derived from information gathered during normal unicast operation. If a unicast packet from A to C passes a router B frequently, B knows that it is on the shortest path from A to C and reverse. If, on the other hand, a router D never sees any unicast packets from A to C, or reverse, it knows, that it is not on a shortest path. This information is then used when a flooding packet from A or C (sender) arrives at either C or D (IS). Only if the IS is on the shortest path, it forwards the packet.   Reverse Path Broadcasting is an improvement of Reverse Path Forwarding. Not only does it evaluate the shortest path according to the IS entry port, where it received the multicast packets like RPF does, but also influences how the packets are then forwarded to the outgoing edges. In contrast to RPF, which just sends the packet over all edges except the incoming one if the packet has arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station are usually sent, i.e. the best route, RPB attempts to send the packet only over suitable edges. Namely those edges, from which it usually receives unicast packets in the reverse direction, because that indicates the best possible route.</response>

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast are broadcast routing algorithms. The purpose of them is that sending a packet to all destinations simultaneously while making full use of bandwidth and do not waste resources. 1. Reverse Pah Forwarding When a broadcast packet arrives at a router, the router checks to see if the packet arrived on the line that is normally used for sending packets from source to destination. If so, the very broadcast packet used the best route until now and is therefore resend over all edges. If not, i.e. the packet did not use such route, it will be discarded like duplicate. 2. Reverse Path Broadcast When a packet arrives at the intermediate system, IS checks to see if the packet arrived at the entry port over which the packets for this souces S are usually sent. If so then it continues checking to see if the packet used the best route until now. If this nested-if holds true, then select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are rerouted to source S. If it holds false, then do not send over all edges.

      <response>We learned about Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse Path Broadcast regarding broadcast routing. 1. Reverse Path Forwarding / Reverse Path Flooding: The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. Therefore, each sender maintains its own spanning tree. The spanning tree gives us information about how much does it cost to reach a node in a tree to deliver a unicast message. There can be different paths to reach this node from sender to recipient - the cheapest path is considered to be the best one. When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network (see slide 9) every node  in the network checks: Is the broadcast message received via the best route the node itself would use to send a unicast message to S? - If it is true: then the node resends the broadcast messages via all edges in the network except the edge over which the broadcast message was received - Otherwise the node will ignore the broadcast message (duplicate) 2. Reverse Path Broadcast The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently distribute broadcast messages. It basically works as Reverse Path Forwarding with one difference: When a broadcast sender S sends a broadcast message to all nodes in the network, every node selects specific edges which are used to resent the message. A node will resent the message via a specific edge if this node is typcially on the path to this node regarding the sending of unicast messages and if it is the best route until now.</response>

      <response>REVERSE PATH FORWARDING (RPF) is a technique used in modern routers for the purposes of ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing and to help prevent IP address spoofing in unicast routing. Network administrators can use Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) to help limit the malicious traffic on an enterprise network. This security feature works by enabling a router to verify the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The principle of RPF is each sender has its own Spanning Tree but IS does not need to know the Spanning Trees. Each router has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Algorithm of RPF is as below: Has this packet arrived at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent? Yes: Assumption: Packet used the BEST route until now Action: resend over all edges (not including the incoming one) No: Assumption: Packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) Action: discard packet (most likely duplicate REVERSE PATH BROADCAST (RPB) is an improvement on RPF. RPB not only evaluates the shortest path in relation to the interface on which the multicast packets are received, but also influences the forwarding of the data to the interface of the router. As a result, the multicast packets are only forwarded to the interfaces at which the next router is in the opposite direction on the shortest path to the data source. To be able to make the decision about forwarding, the routers must be informed about the shortest paths. TRPB routing is an extension of RPB routing. It ensures that the multicast packets do not get into subnets in which there are no current group members. The principle of RPB is every router forwards a broadcast packet to every adjacent router, except the one where it received the packet. A router u accepts a broadcast packet p originating at router s only if p arrives on the link that is on the direct (unicast) path from u to s. The Algorithm of RPB is as below: Has this packet arrived at THE IS entry over which the packets for this station/source S are usually also sent?  YES: Packet used the BEST route until now?   YES: select the edge at which the packets arrived and from which they are then rerouted to source S (in reversed direction)  NO: DO NOT send over all edges (without the incoming one), i.e., not as in Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF)  NO: discard packet (is most likely a duplicate)</response>

The principle of the Reverse Path Forwarding is that each station has a spanning tree that represents the routing to other stations.

If so it is assumed that it used the best path until now and the packet is sent to the other adjacent stations, otherwise it is discarded.  The Reverse Path Broadcast follows a similar approach. It differs in how it handles packets that are received on the entry port packets to this destination are usually assumed at. There is an additional check, if the packet used the best route until now.

      <response>The purpose is to reduce packet duplicates due to flooding. * REVERSE PATH FORWARDING: The receiving router checks, if the incoming packet used the usual (proboably best) path to it. If it is the case, the packet will be forwarded to all links except the one at which the packet arrived. If a packet arrives at an unusual path (probably not the best path and a duplicate), the incoming packet will be ignored (discarded) and not forwarded any farther. * REVERSE PATH BROADCAST: Similiar to _Reverse Path Forwarding except _that a node gains information about the best paths between neighbouring nodes due to observation. That is, a packet will not be forwarded via every link but only via those links, which are unlikely to create more duplicates. For example a node A will not forward a packet to X coming from a node Z, if it knows (due to obeservation), that there exists a best path between X and Z for that packet.</response>

      <response>Both algorithms try to detect duplicate packets in broadcasts and only forward packets that are likely new and need to be forwarded. Other packets are likely duplicates and are discarded.  In Reverse Path Forwarding, each router saves which path a packet takes from a sender S in a unicast communication, considering it to be the shortest path from S. From there on, broadcast packets from S that are not coming over that path are considered to be duplicates and are discarded. Broadcast packets from S coming over that path are accepted and broadcasted to all edges except to the incoming one. One disadvantage of RPF is that the packet is resent over all edges (except the incoming one), but not forwarded only over suitable edges.  In Reverse Path Broadcast, a node also remembers the path taken from a sender S in a unicast communication. Additionally, a node also learns that if it never received a unicast packet from S to another node B, then it is likely not on the shortest path from S to B.

      <response>RPF and RPB are algorithms used to reduce the number of duplicate and unnecessary packets in flooding/broadcasting by inspecting the optimal unicast paths.

If it did not come over the port unicast packets normally would, then the IS discards the packet. In RPB, only specific outgoing ports are selected rather than all ports.  If an IS receives a packet from a source that it would normally receive packets from, it will only forward the packets on the outgoing ports for which it is on the optimal path from source to destination, rather than forwarding on all outgoing ports as in RPF.

      <response>Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) and Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB) are used in broadcasting/ multicasting to route packages on the network. It is assumed that each node has it's own spanning tree of the network, describing the optimal unicast routing paths. If a packet arrives at one intermediate node, it first checks if the packat arrived via the path over which nodes to the sending source are usually sent. Only of this is the case, the packet is further processed. In RPF the incoming packet is simply distributed to all outgoing edges (excluding the incoming edge). In RPB, the pacjet is only distributed via edges for which the router knows they represent the optimal path between the source and the destination (i.e. packets are usually routed via this path).

      <response>The PURPOSE of Reverse Path Forwarding and Reverse path Broadcast is ensuring loop-free forwarding of multicast packets in multicast routing.  In REVERSE PATH FORWARDING, each IS has its own spanning tree instead of a global unified spanning tree and does not need to know other spanning trees. Each IS has information which path it would use for (unicast)-packets. Now if a packet arrives at the IS entry port over which the packets for this station/source are usually also sent, this means: the packet used the BEST route until now and thus resend over all edges (not including the incoming one). If Not, this means the packet did NOT use this route (it is NOT the best route) and thus discard the packet as it is most likely a duplicate. THE PROBLEM WITH REVERSE PATH FORWARDING is that the packet is sent through all edges except for the sender. This is solved by REVERSE PATH BROADCAST. Here, each node learns from the unicast packets. Only If the IS is located on the unicast between the broadcast sender S and a neighbor node B, then it will forward the packet.</response>

      <response>Using Reverse Path forwarding ensures loop-free forwarding of multicast packets. The idea behind this algorithm is: If a packet station X arrives at an IS over an entry point over which the packets for station X are usually sent, this might probably be the correct and fastest route. Therefore only if this is the case packets distributed over all edges. If the packet is received over another entry point it will be discarded. Reverse Path Broadcast is a refined version of this algorithm. It differs from Reverse Path Forwarding by the fact, that if the packets have taken the best route until their arrival at a certain node they will be forwarded to the best next edge taken from the routing table.

The node has to decide, whether the received packet sent over the best route, i.e. it used the edge the node would use to send it back to the sender/author or not. If this is true, the node resends this packet over all other edges, i.e. excluding the incoming one, otherwise, the packet is most likely a duplicate and it will be discarded. The Reverse Path Broadcast goes a little further and the IS sends the packet from the best route only to the nodes it is responsible for/the sender used before.

In Reverse Path Forwarding a node remembers on which path it has previously sent something to another node (assumption that this is the best path based on routing tables) and only accepts and forwards packets from that other node that are returning from that same path. An accepted packet is forwarded on every outgoing link except the one it came from. If packets are coming from other paths they are discarded based on the assumption that they are copies. Reverse Path Broadcasting makes use of the Reverse Path Forwarding principle except that the packets are not forwarded on every outgoing line but only on the ones which are part of a best path between two nodes. Every node is inspecting the flow of a network and can thus find out, whether they are on the best path between two nodes or not. If they are not on that best path they will not forward the packets to those nodes. By doing this the traffic in a network is restricted to less and less packets (fewer copies).</response>
