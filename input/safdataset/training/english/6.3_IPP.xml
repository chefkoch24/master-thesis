      <response>DHCP replaced RARP. It is used to distribute IP Adresses to clients within a network. A client without an adress sends a discover to all DHCP servers in its network. The servers answer with IP adresses, from which the client selects one to use, which is then acknowledged by the corresponding server.</response>

      <response>DHCP is a protocol for assignment and managing unique IP addresses in a network and distributing them to the requesting hosts. With DHCP, every network participant can configure itself automatically. DHCP comes as a client and as a server.
DHCP has mostly replaced the reverse address resolution protocol (RARP), it extends the functionality, but in essence, it is the same thing as the RARP. 
DHCP simplifies installation and configuration of end systems, allows for manual and automatic IP address assignment, and may provide additional configuration information such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and the DNS address.
With DHCP, there is no need for the network administrator to manually configure each participant before it can use the network nor to manually reconfigure participants when their network access point changes, resulting in an easily managed user mobility.</response>

      <response>DHCP is the new version of ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), basically DHCP does the same : 
The DHCP (=Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a communication protocol (for network management) on internet protocols.
A DHCP server is used for assignment : A DHCP server assigns network configurations and IP addresses to devices on a network in 
a dynamic way. As a result, the devices are to work and communicate with other IP networks.
So, DHCP simplifies installation and configuration of end systems, it can assign manual and automatic, dynamic IP addresses to devices in a network and can provide network parameter information like netmask, DNS server, default router and so on.
The IP address assignment is for limited time available only.</response>
      <response_feedback>The definition part in the response is partially correct because DHCP is not a new version of ARP. DHCP uses ARP requests during the IP allocation process but they are separate protocols.</response_feedback>

    <studentAnswer id="6.3_IPP.1415">
      <response>Without DHCP or similar protocols, the administrator of a network element or computer needs to assign an unused IP address in the adequate network range to the device by hand.
DHCP is a protocol to ease this process and to provide network elements with an IP address in an automated way. This can be a manual or an automatic assignment. In manual mode, a specific IP address will be permanently assigned to a certain MAC address. In automatic mode, an IP address will be temporarily assigned (lease) and freed if no renewal occurs. This provides efficient use of addresses without blocking addresses if no device uses it. The DHCP server is configured to manage a pool of possible IP addresses in the network and also knows other configuration data (e.g. DNS, netmask).
The DHCP protocol also allows to configure the network elements with other important network details like DNS servers, netmask, default router, and other items. If a network element needs to join a network, it sends a broadcast message (DISCOVER) to the network. A DHCP server picks this message up and provides the necessary information to the network element as described above. There should not be more than 1 DHCP server in a network. If the DHCP server resides on another LAN segment, a DHCP relay agent can forward the respective messages to/from the DHCP server.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response answers the definition and the usage of DHCP correctly. There can be more than 1 DHCP server for a subnet provided the address range is unique for both of them so that there are no overlapping addresses they can allot.</response_feedback>

      <response>DHCP is a new version of RARP and BOOTP but more or less does the same thing. Most of the time its a router that can both manually or automatically assign IP addresses (and other information such as DNS Server, netmask, default router etc. ) to clients in its domain. The request from the clients is a broadcast request, the DHCP server then answers. 
A big advantage is the dynamic allocation of IP addresses. Each address is given out with a lease timer. A client has to refresh his lease before the timer runs out. If it does, and the client has not refreshed his lease, that IP address can once again be assigned to a new client. Therefore it allows to reclaim addresses of disappearing hosts.</response>
      <response_feedback>The definition/description is partially correct as it is a separate protocol or a successor protocol with extended functionality and not a new version of RARP and BOOTP.</response_feedback>

      <response>DHCP is a protocol for assigning IP addresses in a network. It works similarly to RARP. A host can send a request to a DHCP server with its MAC address and the server responds with the assigned IP address and possibly additional configuration information.  IP addresses are assigned for limited time only.  Clients must therefore renew their IP adress at regular intervals. This means that unused IP configurations are not blocked in the long term.</response>

      <response>DHCP is a protocol which runs on the server of a local network, for example on a LAN. There it serves for introduction of new devices to the network itself: First of all, it helps with the automatic or manual assignment of an IP address, then it also delivers meta-information about the network itself, for example about DNS servers, the netmask or the default router. To start the DHCP service, the new device has to send a “DHCP Discover Packet”, which is then answered by the DHCP server in the system. If the server is on another LAN, there is a DHCP relay agent which helps to transmit the request there. IP addresses are only assigned by DHCP for a limited time, so that after log-out of the device, the IP address attached to it before can be reused.</response>
