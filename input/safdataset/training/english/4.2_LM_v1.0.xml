      <response>Frame bursting is a way to increase the speeds of the ethernet protocol in the shared broadcast mode. To meet the minimum frame length requirements at the greater speeds multiple frames are concatenated to a single, larger frame. This allows to detect collisions with faster speeds at the cost of a delay when sending a larger frame. One advantage over the carrier extension is the improved throughput, at the cost of an increased latency (disadvantage).</response>

      <response>In frame bursting, instead of the sender sending one packet at a time, it sends ten packets at once. The sender waits for the packets until it has ten packets ready to send. Put them together and just then send them.

Advantage: better performance than carrier extension, since more data is sent at a time.

Disadvantage: if there are only one or two packets to send, the sender will be waiting for the remain, to reach the 10 packets. If there are not 10 packets, after a timeout, the sender adds rubbish to the frame (so it has the needed size). So, the packets will be sent with a delay and with unnecessary data.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response correctly answers the advantage and disadvantage part. However, the definition part is only partially correct as it states that the sender sends 10 packets at once, but there is no specification regarding the number of packets to be sent in one frame. The appropriate definition of frame bursting is that it reduces the overhead of transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission.</response_feedback>

      <response>In gigabit ethernet with a shared medium, the small frame size is not large enough to enable collision detection.  There are two ways to solve this: carrier extension and frame bursting.  In frame bursting, multiple frames are concatenated together and transmitted at the same time.  In carrier extension, a single frame is padded with extra data.  Frame bursting is more efficient than carrier extension, but it requires some wait time before sending in order to collect enough frames to concatenate.  It also requires timeouts in case that not enough data arrives in time.  Carrier extension doesn't have these issues, but is only 9% efficient, which cancels out the benefit of added speed of gigabit ethernet.</response>

      <response>Frame bursting is a concept which is supported by Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3z) in shared broadcast mode. This concept allows the sender to transfer multiple frames as a concatenated sequence to the recipient with only one transmission. 

Advantage: 
To understand the advantage of frame bursting we need to compare it with another concept which is also supported by Gigabit Ethernet: Carrier extension. Carrier extension ensures to reach the minimal frame size by using padding which may (!) result in a waste of brandwith. This is the case if you need to add a large padding to reach the minimum frame size. As a solution, frame bursting optimizes the relation between actual payload and padding. So it is more efficient and does not result in a waste of brandwith.

Disadvantage:
A disadvantage of frame bursting is that the sender has to wait until there are enough frames which can then be transmitted with only one message (one transmission) as described above.</response>

      <response>Frame bursting reduces the overhead for transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission, without ever releasing control of the channel.[1]

Advantage: Higher efficiency as single frames not filled up with garbage (as carrier extension would do it)
Disadvantage: It may take longer time to concatenate and send multiple frames. The buffer may be full or the transmission can be stalled by the other side buffer. Thus, no speed up by higher layers is possible. Furthermore, a timeout is needed to detect if a station is not sending anymore i.e. to send the last two packets and prevent it from waiting forever.

Main decision: If something is more time critical, better use Carrier extension (less efficiency), if not frame bursting may be the better choice (with higher end-to-end delay).</response>

      <response>Frame bursting is one of two features of shared broadcast mode in IEEE 802.3z. In this case we allow sender to put few data frames together and send them in a single transmission. Compared to the carrier extension, we get better efficiency (in carrier extension we use only ~10% of the frame length to send data), but on the other side we need to consider what if there is no enough frames to send the data. For example, we are able to send 10 frames together, but if we have only 8, sometimes is not very efficient to wait for another frames. In this case some mechanism has to be implemented (such as filling remaining space with rubbish data).</response>

However, the answer also states the 9% efficiency of carrier extension which is only valid in worst case scenario.

      <response>Frame bursting enables the sender to transmit concentrated sequence of multiple spaces in a single transmission. Therefore a buffer waits for a set of packets to send them all once together.
 An advantage of frame bursting is the high efficiency due to the amount of data that can be sent in one transmission. In the carrier extension only 9% user data is possible to send which leads to a low efficiency. 
A disadvantage of frame bursting is the long time it takes to be transmitted. If you just want to send two packets you have to put some additional data or rubbish inside because the frame only will send if the whole frame is filled with data. The higher latency is introduced through the packing/filling of the buffer, depending on the implementation, either the two packages get stuck or transmitted with a higher latency with rubbish frames to fill the buffer.  This causes a delay. Therefore the carrier extension is better to send less packages and does not lead to a delay.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response answers all three parts of the question correctly. However, 9% efficiency of the carrier extension feature is only for the worst case. The efficiency depends on the  size of actual data sent which can be between 46-1500 bytes.</response_feedback>

      <response>To still be able to detect collisions at a high speed (as in the Gigabit Ethernet protocol), longer packets are needed. There are several options to form a larger frame size and one of them is frame bursting. In this method a set of shorter packets is concatenated and then all the packets are sent together as one large frame. 

The advantage of this method is that there is a high efficiency/high throughput, as every part of a frame consists of usable data in comparison to carrier extension where padding is added to every frame and only a short percentage of a frame contains data.

The disadvantage of this method is a higher end-to-end delay as we need to wait in order for the buffer to fill up, which poses a disadvantage especially in interactive services. In comparison, the carrier extension method is much faster because every packet is sent directly. Furthermore, another problem occurs when the buffer is partly vacant and no more data comes in to fill it up. In that case the data already present in the buffer has to wait and cannot be sent.</response>

      <response>Frame Bursting enables several short frames to be sent directly one after the other without carrier extension. This reduces the overhead caused by several individual frames and thus allows more efficient use of the network load.
The disadvantage of this method is that devices with frame bursting can reserve more transmission time. Devices without frame bursting then get correspondingly less access to the data channel.</response>
      <response_feedback>The disadvantage given is correct for frame bursting in general. However, if you use it as a substitution for carrier extension, the goal is to reach the minimum frame length/transmission time needed for collisions to be detectable. Therefore, increasing transmission time is not a disadvantage in this case. Apart from that, the answer is correct.</response_feedback>

Frame bursting scales better. Independet of how big the overall payload is, the frames fit perfectly. The CD always has 512 bytes of payload which can be inefficient if the payload is only 50 byte.
On the other hand, sending exactly 512 byte is more efficient with the CD as it has to send only one frame while frame bursting needs to send 64 frames where each of them has an overhead of 16 to 24 bytes.</response>

      <response>To use CSMA-CD with a fast connection, the packet size needs to be increased, messages with a size of 512 byte are sent instead of 512 bit.
"Frame bursting" is one feature to reach the desired larger packet-size. Using "frame bursting", smaller frames are concatenated to a sequence of frames. If this sequence is still not large enough, the hardware adds padding to reach 512 byte of size.

"Carrier extension" fills the 512 bit messages with padding, until the message has the required size of 512 byte. Since the actual frame is still just 64 byte (46 byte user data), the efficiency is very low (9%). In contrast to carrier extension, "frame bursting" has a quite high line efficiency. Especially if there are enough frames waiting to be transmitted. The downside of "frame bursting" is the increased delay due to waiting for frames to send.</response>

      <response>For a shared broadcast mode a tradeoff between distance and efficiency must be done.
One solution is frame bursting : In frame bursting the packet to be transmitted are put together, in a buffer. And after a specific 
wait time, there are 10 packets to be send together. If there is a error, the procedure will be repeated. 
If  the concatenated sequence of multiple packets has no error and all is good, the packets will be sent. 

+1 advantage : Better efficiency compared to 'carrier extension' because no additional "rubbish" data is added to the actual frame,
but in frame bursting it is waited for real data packets to be added in a buffer.

-1 disadvantage : The waiting time could cause delay, because f.e. a sender always has to wait till the buffer is full and till

      <response>- Definition: We don't send a packet immediately, but wait for many packets, put them all in a queue. Then send them all ( all packet in the queue) in a single transmission. So, we have not only one but multiple frames in this single transmission.

-Advantage: It will increase the efficiency, good for Data Transfer. 
Explain:
+ If we send each frame individually, each frame must be attached with some additional field(like checksum...), these fields are not data. The receiver will throw them away anyway.
 + If we can reduce these fields as much as we can, we can increase the efficiency. And the "frame bursting " is the idea. Instead of inserting additional fields for every packet, we gather multiple packets together, and insert the additional fields into this single burst.

-Disadvantage: Very high delay. It's a very bad choice for interactive applications which requires low latency.

The limiting factor when transmitting data while using CD is the time it takes to send the data.

Therefore the station accumulates multiple frames and sends them as a single transmission, increasing the time it takes to send the data.

      <response>The solution for maintaining a high collision domain diameter with increased transmission speed is to also increase the length of the sent frames. Frame bursting in this context means combining multiple small frames to one concatenated sequence of then increased length. This allows collision detection on the same length of line as before with increased speed because incread sequence length and higher transmission speed together mean a unchanged duration of transmission for every node in the network. 
We have to have a look on the advantages and disadvantages of frame bursting, especially in comparison to carrier extension. Carrier extension is another attempt to longer frames by adding more zero-padding bits to every frame with the same data section length as before:

-Advantage: In comparison to carrier extension, the long sequences in frame bursting contain more information, because no (or at least less) zero padding is needed. So the percentage of data per sequence is higher than it is with carrier extension, where most of the package consists of padding fields. So we have a higher efficiency, especially in respect of line usage.

-Disadvantage: Frame bursting needs time of waiting for every node before sending, because a certain amount of frames has to be collected to concatenate them to a sequence of minimum length. So the delay of sending is increased. One has also to think about the best trade-off between waiting time and frame collection, for example when to stop waiting and adding padding zeros.</response>

This is more efficient than carrier extension in a fast network, because you don't have top send "rubbish" data, just to enlarge the frame. The disadvantage is that the sender might want to send 1 frame immediately, but has to wait for 9 others to be ready to send. This might cause a delay.</response>
      <response_feedback>The response correctly answers the frame bursting definition, its advantage and disadvantage.</response_feedback>

      <response>Advantage: better efficiency
Disadvantage: needs frame waiting for transmission</response>
      <response_feedback>The response correctly states the advantage and the disadvantage of frame bursting. However, it does not contain a definition. Frame bursting reduces the overhead of transmitting small frames by concatenating a sequence of multiple frames in one single transmission.</response_feedback>

      <response>Frame busting is a transmission technique used to increase the rate of transmission of data frames. It puts a set of packets together and sends them in one single transmission.
An advantage is the increased efficiency.
A disadvantage is the delay that comes with this technique, because it lengthens the frame and therefore extends the transmission time.</response>
