<question id="4.13">
  <questionText>Consider the following network topology from the lecture:With routing, we want to find the best path for our packets. For this, we first need to define a metric to evaluate the quality of a path. One possible choice could be the current load (i.e. the current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes) on this path. Assume that A wants to send data to G, could this routing strategy cause any problems at the receiver end? Please explain your answer in 1-2 sentences.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="4.13.a1">Yes, using the current load to find the best path can lead to fluctuations/oscillations when there is more than one path between any pair of end systems in the network (here: CF and EI). This can cause packet reorderings at the receiving side.</referenceAnswer>

    <studentAnswer id="4.13.366">
      <response>Yes, this strategy would have the problem of oscillation. For example, if we assume that the traffic goes through the CF path, this means that this path is heavily loaded and has high delays. Since the waiting time for the calculation of the shortest path is included in the weighting, connection EI now appears more attractive. New routing tables are created and the traffic then runs over connection EI, which is now heavily loaded. In the next step, connection CF appears more attractive again due to the smaller load, and so on. There follows a permanent change between the connections CF and EI, which is bad. A consequence of this is that the routing tables fluctuate strongly and this leads to erratic routing (instability), which is a big problem for the receiving side (packet loss/wrong packet order/additional overhead).</response>

First of all it is possible that the current load changes over time. This would mean that the originally best path evaluated by the algorithm may be slower since there is more data send by other sources.
In Addition to that Problem there is also a problem with a change in topology. For example new nodes could lead to a faster way of tramitting data  but the algo doesnt take them into cosideration since was run allready.</response>

      <response>It may cause problems in a network with load fluctuations because with A sending data over a path the load on this particular path increases and therefore A might choose another path creating a ping pong effect where finding the best path may not terminate because it switches the path constantly.

Another problem may be that the links between the nodes have different maximum capacities, e. g. one link has 10 Gbit/s and another link 1Gbit/s. Finding the path with the lowest current utilization in terms of sent packets/bytes may choose the nearly full 1Gbit/s link because of a relatively low utilization although the 10Gbit/s link has more capacity.
