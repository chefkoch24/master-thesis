      <response>Firstly, duplicates reduce the data rate, but more importantly, if not detected, duplicate packets can, e.g., trigger re-execution of transactions or actions in general. This can result in faulty behavior or can be used for malicious means.</response>

    <studentAnswer id="5.11.93">
      <response>First, duplicates take up unnecessary space within the whole network and leading to heavier congestion secondly, duplicates require some kind of knowledge (state) at the receiver to determine if it's actually a duplicate (e.g sequence number). Also, the identifier should be unique within multiple sessions to avoid discarding packages (false positives) that are no real duplicates.</response>
