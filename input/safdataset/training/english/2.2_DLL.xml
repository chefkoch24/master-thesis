  <questionText>What is the difference between asynchronous and synchronous transmission mode in the Data Link Layer.</questionText>
  <referenceAnswers>
    <referenceAnswer id="2.2_DLL.a1">Asynchronous transmission: Every character a self-contained unit surrounded by a start bit and a stop bit, which is an easy and cheap pattern, but causes low transmission rates.

Synchronous transmission: Several characters pooled to a continuous stream of data (frames), Frames defined by SYN or flag, higher complexity, but higher transmission rates. Requires synchronization between sender and receiver.</referenceAnswer>

      <response>In a asynchronous transmission every character which is sent, is bounded by a start bit and an end bit.

In synchronous transmissions a whole lot of characters can be send back-to-back and this big package is bounded by "Flag" or "SYN" which are characters. Bounding Frames can be either character oriented, counter oriented or bit oriented.</response>

      <response>Asynchronous has byte-oriented and block-oriented protocols. During asynchronous transmission, each character is bounded by a start bit and a stop bit. This kind of transmission is simple and inexpensive, but low transmission rates, often up to 200 bit/ second

Synchronous has character-oriented, count-oriented and bit-oriented protocols. Several characters are pooled to frames. These frames are defined by SYN or flag. This kind of transmission is more complex, but higher transmission rate.</response>

      <response>Asynchronous:
- Is Byte or Block oriented, 
- Blocks contain a start and stop bit with a n-Byte payload
- More simple and inexpensive


Synchronous:
- Is character oriented ( or count or Bit oriented)
- Frame beginnings are Flagged (SYN)
- More complex, higher transmission rates
- Works with L2 Frames built out of L1 Frames

- Character oriented Frame begins with SYN, STX flags
- End with ETX/ Error Check frames
- If Datapart contains control chars: Data Link escaping applied
- If control characters are in User generated Data, they are flagged too (stuffed)
-&gt; slower than asynchronous

- Count oriented Frames :
 - Transmits length of the next sent data, then sends data of length of the count
- Also hats control and error check fields
 -  Problem: transmission errors might corrupt the whole transmission

- Bit oriented Frames:
   - Has a Block definiton
   - Control and error check fields
   -  Uses bit stuffing to escape Flags in the user data</response>

      <response>In asynchronous transmission every character is sent individually and is bounded by a start and stop bit. This method is very simple but only works at low transmission rates. 
In synchronous transmission several characters form a frame. The start and end of a frame is defined by SYN or Flag. There are multiple possibilities for bounding frames, such as control characters or length count fields. Each of these bring problems with them that have to be solved. For instance, in character Oriented Protocols user data may contain control characters which can cause a too early end of the frame. One Solution for that is characterstuffing, where each control character is preceded by Data Link Escape(a specific bitstream that means: "the following data is a control character").</response>

This allows for high transmission rates but is quite complex. Asynchronous transmissions mark where each single transmitted character begins and ends through a start and stop bit. This technique is simpler and less expensive, but only allows for low transmission rates.</response>

      <response>Transmission mode is always about the question how to transmit a sequence of characters via any communication networks:

-Asynchronous transmission means, that every character is sent alone, bounded by start and stop bits. this technology is easy to implement, but does not allow high data rates.

-In synchronous transmission, we bound following characters together in one frame. The frame then is bounded by flag bits or synchronization characters. While it takes a bit more implementation effort it also allows higher transmission rates.</response>

      <response>In the Asynchronous transmission data is sent in a constant current of bytes where each character is bounded by a start and stop bit. These inform the receiver about where the sent data starts and stops but create an overhead for the data transmission. Asynchronous transmission is rather simple and inexpensive but has a low transmission rate.

In the Synchronous transmission several characters are pooled to frames and they are defined by SYN or flag. It is more complex than the asynchronous model because you need to define when the data starts and stops (Character, Count or Bit oriented) as there are no spaces included between the data.

      <response>In asynchronous transmission, each byte/character is prepended with a start bit and appended with a stop bit, so that the receiver can tell them apart. This is a very simple mechanism, but it introduces a lot of overhead for larger chunks of data, and also isn't suitable for high transmission rates.

Synchronous transmission increases the header size, but in turn introduces so-called frames, which group multiple bytes together. The header is used to enable the receiver to tell apart the different frames, and although it is larger than the start/stop bit in asynchronous transmission, the total overhead for larger chunks of data is much smaller and therefore allows for higher transmission rates.</response>

It is simple, good for low transmission rates, but not for high transmission rates, because for than more byte the bytes (with start and stop bit)

For synchronous transmission many bytes are tied together to one frame with on flag in the beginning and one in the end.
